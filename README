Motivation for EfficientNet
----------------------------
Many networks focus on optimizing the architecture and the operators in order to achieve target performance. While this method does work it doesn't concern itself with the practicality of deploying said network. 

Meanwhile, model scaling applies a compound scaling to existing models in order to achieve competitive accuracy while being respectful of resource limitations (measured as FLOPS).


To-do
-----
- Remove static model architecture and priors (phi)
- Add more robust outputs for probing model performance
- Add grid search for parameter discovery dynamically
